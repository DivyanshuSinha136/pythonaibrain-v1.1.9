## Camera Method

The \`pyaitk\` toolkit supports Camera to click photos and make videos. It can save photos/videos and send them to \`pyaitk\` \`Brain method\` for processing.

### Example: Start your camera

\`\`\`python
import pyaitk
from pyaitk import Camera
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()          # Create GUI
Camera(root)            # Start camera and pass root as master
root.mainloop()         # Run the GUI
\`\`\`

Or simply:

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk.Camera import Start
Start()
\`\`\`

Or via Brain module:

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain

brain = Brain()
brain.load()
brain.process_messages('Click Photo')
\`\`\`

---

## TTS (Text To Speech) Method

Converts text to speech in male or female voice.

### Example

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import TTS

tts = TTS(text='Hello World')
tts.say(voice='david')    # Male voice in windows
tts.say(voice='zira')  # Female voice in windows
tts.say(voice= 'alex') # Male voice in macos
tts.say(voice= 'samantha') # Female voice in macos
tts.say(voice= 'english') # for linux
\`\`\`

By default, \`tts.say()\` uses the male voice of windows so agrest with your device type, also see the TTS __doc__.

---

You should know the voice for different OS

Other ways to use TTS.

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import speak

text = "Hello World" # Taking a text
speak(text) # speak functions speak the given text without doing all the setup of TTS method.
\`\`\`

#### Syntax for speak function

\`\`\`text
speak(text: str = 'Hi', voice: str = <accordind to device type>):
\`\`\`

#### What speak function returns?

\`speak\` function returns \`None\`.

> Note: You can also set voice according to your choice

## PTT (PDF To Text) Function

PTT (\`PPT To Text\`) function extract text from the given \`.pdf\` file.

### Example

\`\`\`python
import pyaitk
from pyaitk import PTT

ptt = PTT(path='example.pdf')  # Provide your file path
print(ptt)                     # Extracted text output
\`\`\`

---

#### What PPT function returns?

The PPT function return the extracted text in the string formate.

## MathAI Function

It is a \`built-in function\` in \`pyaitk\` for solving \`complex\`, and \`symbolic\` math problems.

### Way to use MathAI function

#### Steps

* First \`import MathAI\` function from \`pyaitk module\`.

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import MathAI
\`\`\`

* Create a variable for storing query in string formate.

\`\`\`python
query = "X + Y - 2X + 3Y" # let's take a query
\`\`\`

* Now get the answer from the \`MathAI\` function for the query.

\`\`\`python
answer = MathAI(query= query) # MathAI gives the answer in string formate.
\`\`\`

* After that print the answer.

\`\`\`python
print(answer)
\`\`\`

From this way we can ask any query of math with \`MathAI\`.

#### Full Code

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import MathAI

query = "X + Y - 2X + 3Y" # let's take a query
answer = MathAI(query= query) # MathAI gives the answer in string formate.

print(answer)
\`\`\`

> Note: MathAI have fixed pattern of prompts, means you can ask question in direct form not question with string like,
>
> \`\`\`python
>query = "Solve X + Y - 2X + 3Y"
>\`\`\`
>
>Try to ask direct questions only.

* First \`import Search\` method from \`pyaitk module\`.

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Search
\`\`\`

* Assigne a varible for query

\`\`\`python
query = 'pythonaibrain'
\`\`\`

* Assigne a varible, and pass query in it.

\`\`\`python
search = Search(query = query)
\`\`\`

* > If no query given it by default takes 'pythonaibrain' as a query.

* Run the run funcition inside Search to get all top five answers, links, summaries.

\`\`\`python
search.run()
\`\`\`

* Get answer.

\`\`\`python
search.get_results_str()
\`\`\`

* > Note: It return all the answer in string formate, so we will try to fetch all the answers in a variable.

* Fetch answer.

\`\`\`python
answer = search.get_results_str()
\`\`\`

* At last print all the fetch answers.

\`\`\`python
print(answer)
\`\`\`

#### Full code

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Search

query = 'pythonaibrain'

search = Search(query)
search.run()

# Get answer.

answer = search.get_results_str()

# print the fetched answer.

print(answer)

## Memory Method

It is use for \`LTM\` (\`Long-Term-Memory\`) ans \`STM\` (\`Short-Term-Memory\`), or we can say \`LSTM\` (\`Long-Short-Term-Memory\`)

### Way to use Memory Method

#### Steps

* First we will \`import Memory\` method from \`pyaitk module\`.

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import memory
\`\`\`

* After that.

\`\`\`python
memory = Memory() # you can pass name of your memory file otherwise it by default takes memory.json
\`\`\`

* > Note : The memory file extention should be \`.json\`

* Now we will remember function for remember.

\`\`\`python
memory.remember('user', 'Hi') # It takes key value pairs as a parameter.
\`\`\`

* Now we recall the messages.

\`\`\`python
memory.recall('user') # It takes key as a peremeter.
\`\`\`

* Now we save the memory for LTM.

\`\`\`python
memory.save_memory() # It saves the memory for long time.
\`\`\`

* Now we load our LTM.

\`\`\`python
memory.load_memory() # It load our saved memory, but if the memory is not saved it takes empty dict.
\`\`\`

* If we want to delete our existing memory we will use  \`clear_memory\` function.

\`\`\`python
memory.clear_memory() # It cleare all the data to our memory.
\`\`\`

* > Remember : It will not delete the file.

---

## Contexts Method

\`Contexts\` method extract sutable answer asked by user from the given context.

### Example

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Contexts

context = '''
Patanjali Ayurved is an Indian company. It was founded by Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna in 2006.
'''

question = 'Who founded Patanjali Ayurved?'
contexts = Contexts()
answer = contexts.ask(context=context, question=question)
print(answer)
\`\`\`

---

#### What Contexts method returns?

The \`Contexts\` method itself rethurn nothing, but it's ask attribute returns \`answers\` in \`string\` formate.

---

## Brain Method

It is a powerfull method which allow you to create a smart \`AI\` \`models\` and \`chatbots\`. It gives you better flexibility to work on your model.

You can also give your dataset to train it. It also supports \`function mapping\`.

You can also download \`pre-trained\` models from it.

> Note: Not all models, you can download models which supports pythonaibrain.

### Ways to use Brain Method

#### Steps

* First we will \`import Brain\` from \`pyaitk module\`.

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain
\`\`\`

* Let's create brain of our chatbot.

\`\`\`python
brain = Brain() # You can pass your intents path, and functions for function mapping.
\`\`\`

* Let's load our default model.

\`\`\`python
brain.load() # It loads the default model
\`\`\`

* If you give your dataset then you should train and save your model.

\`\`\`python
brain = Brain('intents.json')

brain.train() # It takes few minutes or may be hour, it depends you dataset size.
brain.save()
\`\`\`

* Let's start chatting with default model (in basic style).

\`\`\`python
while True:
    message = input('Message : ')
    answer = brain.process_messages(answer)
    brain.pyai_say(answer)
\`\`\`

* Other ways to talk with our model (in advance style).

\`\`\`python
while True:
    message = input('Message : ')
    answer = brain.talk(answer, grammer= False, TTS= True) # You can also close TTS by passing TTS= False.
    brain.write(answer)
\`\`\`

#### Full Code

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain

brain = Brain()

# def Hello():
#     return "Hello"
# brain = Brain(intents_path= 'intents.json', hello= Hello)
# brain.train()
# brain.save()

brain.load()

while True:
    message = input("Message : ")
    # answer = brain.process_messages(message)
    answer = brain.talk(message, grammer= False, TTS= True)
    # brain.pyai_say(answer)
    brain.write(answer)

# for more detail about functions run:
# print(brain.__all__)
\`\`\`

#### Functions of \`Brain\` method

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain

brain = Brain()
\`\`\`

* If you want to know the model is loaded or not, then use \`is_loaded\` function.

\`\`\`python
brain.is_loaded()
\`\`\`

It returns True/ False.

* If you want to know the model is saved or not, then use \`is_saved\` function.

\`\`\`python
brain.is_saved()
\`\`\`

It also returns True/ False.

* Or, if you want to konw the model is trained or not, then use \`is_trained\` function.

\`\`\`python
brain.is_trained()
\`\`\`

It also returns True/ False.

* If you want to know type of inputed message then use \`predict_message_type\` function.

\`\`\`python
brain.predict_message_type('What is your name?') # Returns -> Question.
\`\`\`

##### What \`predict_message_type\` function can returns for the message

* Question
* Answer
* Command
* Shutdown
* Make Directory
* Statement
* Name
* Know
* Start

###### Notes:

* \`Shutdown\` and \`Start\` commands require terminal support and
**do not work on Android or iOS.**

* \`Make Directory\` creates folders on your device.
* \`Statement\` is any plain text that is not a command/question.
* \`Name\` detects if a message contains a person's name.

### How to create \`intents.json\`

\`\`\`json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "What's up?", "Howdy"],
      "responses": ["Hello! How can I help you today?", "Hey there!", "Hi! What can I do for you?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "bye",
      "patterns": ["Bye", "See you soon", "Take care"],
      "responses": ["Bye! Have a great day", "See you"]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Save this as a \`.json\` file and provide it to the Brain module.

### Other way

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain

brain = Brain(intents_path='intents.json')  # or Brain() with default
brain.train()
brain.save()
message = input('Message: ')
message_type = brain.predict_message_type(message=message)

if message_type in ['Question', 'Answer']:
    print(f'Answer: {brain.process_messages(message=message)}')
\`\`\`

Note : train and save the file when use first time or change the default intents.json with your intents.json otherwise use load function by writting,

\`\`\`python
brain.load() # it returns bool
\`\`\`

And also don't forgot to load otherwise it through an error
Or,

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import Brain

brain = Brain()
brain.load()
message = input('Message: ')
message_type = brain.predict_message_type(message=message)

if message_type in ['Question', 'Answer']:
    print(f'Answer: {brain.process_messages(message=message)}')
\`\`\`

---

## Advance Brain Module

An advanced version of the Brain module with smarter classification and better entity recognition.

### Usage

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import AdvanceBrain

advance_brain = AdvanceBrain(intents_path='intents.json')  # or AdvanceBrain()

message = input('Message: ')
message_type = advance_brain.predict_message_type(message=message)

if message_type in ['Question', 'Answer']:
    print(f'Answer: {advance_brain.process_messages(message=message)}')
\`\`\`

### Same limitations apply as Brain module for commands.

## Built-in AI Assistant - PyAgent

If you prefer not to code your own AI, use the built-in **PyAgent** GUI or web assistant.

### GUI

\`\`\`python
import PyAgent
PyAgent.App()
\`\`\`

### Web Server

\`\`\`python
from PyAgent import PYAS
PYAS.app.run(debug=False)
\`\`\`

Or

\`\`\`python
from PyAgent import Server
server = Server()
server.run()
\`\`\`

### Socket Client-AI Server

Make your own client-AI server for handling multiples client togeather, for client side we use \`pythonaibrain-client\` module.

#### Install pythonaibrain-client

\`\`\`bash
pip install pythonaibrain-client
\`\`\`

After that,

\`\`\`python
from pyaibrain.client import ClientServer

cServer = ClientServer()
cServer.serve()
\`\`\`

This will create client side in cli (\`Command Line Interface\`).

### Socket Server

\`\`\`python
from pyaitk import server

server()
\`\`\`

From this way we can make main server for which handle clients.
